### Mobile-first / Responsive
With Bootstrap employing a mobile-first strategy you have to add the responsive viewport ```<meta>``` tag. Doing so ensures everything is rendered properly and that touch zooming works as it should do.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
