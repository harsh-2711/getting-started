##  Introduction
-   Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a Micro Service. Developing Services with spring Boot is too cool.

-   Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

## Getting Started
-   To start working with Spring Boot, we will require to do basic installations.

    -    [Installing Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)<br>
    -    [Installing IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html)

-   Checkout starter project and you will be ready to implement Spring Boot as your backend technology to create Services.<br>

-   In this folder, you will find all the getting-started resources about Spring Boot and Spring Boot Starter Projects. Basic REST Services will be made available to this folder.

##  Goal
-   Provide quick start for projects with flavour of Spring Boot.<br>
-   Provide a range of features that are common to large classes of projects.

##  Prerequisites
-   You should know Java. You should understand the usage of Annotations. You can learn more about Annotations from [here](https://springframework.guru/spring-framework-annotations/)<br>
-   You should understand the basics of Spring framework.<br>
-   Should have a basic understanding of JPA.
