# getting-started

Get started with your next big project without worrying trying multiple frontend-backend combinations or getting stuck with figuring out how to pass environment variables in Kubernetes pods, etc.

## 📌 Introduction

This repository contains information of almost all the tools and technologies used in Software Development to get you started with your next project. Each folder in this repository represents a technology which can be used to build your next big project. Every folder contains a boilerplate template to get you started with your project. The folder also contains one `README` file which will help you get acquainted with ABCs of that particular technology/language, if your starting new or are an explorer (like me 😁)

## ⭐ How to get started?

Following is the top-level directory layout of the repository -

```
.
├── frontend             # Templates for frontend technologies
├── backend              # Templates for backend technologies
├── devops               # Templates for devops tools
├── mobile               # Templates for mobile technologies
├── full-stack           # Templates for combination of frontend and backend technologies
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains multiple sub-folders which contains the template 

To directly pull any template to local machine, paste the following command in the terminal -

```
svn checkout https://github.com/harsh-2711/getting-started/trunk/<domain>/<technology>
```

Replace `domain` with the top-level directory name i.e. frontend, backend, etc. and `technology` with the concerned language for which you need boilerplate code i.e. react, node, etc.
